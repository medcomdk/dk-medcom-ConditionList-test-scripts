### Background

This Implementation Guide (IG) has two purposes: 1) to present test scripts for sending ConditionList v. 1.0, and 2) to present test examples used in the testprotocol for receiving ConditionList. Both test scripts and test examples are developed by MedCom. 

The purpose of a ConditionList is to gather selected diagnoses into a condition list, thereby providing a well-defined overview of the patient's current health status and previously significant relevant diagnoses. The diagnoses included in the ConditionList are exclusively selected to be shared by the patient's general practitioner.
